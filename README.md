A rust library made to parse a Spacebattles story/thread.\
I got really fed up with having to manually check the four-hundred or so stories I've been following for updates.\
The main reason I made a new library instead of just using one of the ten or so programs is because I intend to make a follow-up project using this library w/ Tauri to make a story reader on my phone.\
:P

# To-do:
- [X] Get threadmark list from RSS feed
- [X] Parse threadmarks from RSS feed
- [X] Add requesting system to query each threadmark for updates
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
