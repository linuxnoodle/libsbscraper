# libsbscraper
A rust library made to parse a Spacebattles story/thread.\
I got really fed up with having to manually check the four-hundred or so stories I've been following for updates, and push notifications are just way too intrusive, so I'm also planning on making a subsequent tauri program to compile all of my reading needs into a single android app.\
:P

# To-do:
- [X] Get threadmark list from RSS feed
- [X] Parse threadmarks from RSS feed
- [ ] Scrape text/image/markdown data from each threadmark (probably will just end up copying the HTML over at this rate)
- [ ] Format internal SQLite database to handle story updates
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
